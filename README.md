Uses of CSS
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML.

CSS allows you to control the layout of multiple web pages all at once, saving a lot of work.
It enables the separation of content from design, making maintenance easier and providing more flexibility in presentation.
CSS enhances the accessibility of web pages by allowing for responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes and devices.
